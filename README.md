# Gaui X3L Speed
 
* Ver 1.0: Initial version  


After getting my Gaui R5, I got the bug for speed. The R5 is a fantastic heli but I was looking for something even smaller for quick trips to the field. As it obviously had to be a Gaui heli the choice was simplified as the X3L had a fuselage and would support a motor that was much larger than a 325-280mm heli would normally use. The next decision was two or three blades. Never had a three blade heli and have fancied one but also liked the idea of greater stability on a small size heil. So got the: 

Gaui X3L Basic Kit 3 blade - X3L Basic Kit

The tail is never highly loaded on a speed heli and the 3 blade tail setup would just cause more drag therfore reduce the max speed. So ordered up some:

X3 Tail Pitch Slider Set (X3 雙推螃蟹夾座)
X3 Tail Rotor Grip Assembly (X3 尾旋翼夾頭組)

For servos I wanted to run a high votage setup. As I was in Taiwan the little Align servos looked good and had nice red fins to match the body colour:

Align DS455M servo
Align DS450M servo

For the motor there was only one choice. The monster Scorpion HK-3226. And to support the top of the motor shart I added the: 

Engine second bearing mount(for X3L)   

Also to support the blades I added the:

X3 Main Blade Grips Parts Upgrade Pack (for 3 Blade)

For esc I tried the Hobbywing 50 but the telemetry setup is not great on it as it required a j-log to get the info I needed on PWM, and headspeed. It also had not current sensor, so a MUI50 was needeed too. A lot of extra electronics to fit in a small heli. YGE came out with their telemtry line. So I took out the Hobbywing (it has now gone in a standard X3 since) and put in a Yge 65lvt esc. This outputs directly to the Jeti RX and has a current sensor built in. Really nice esc, that also has an anti-spark setup. I use 5mm bullets. Since its launch Scorpion has now added an 80amp Tribunus. If this was out at the time I would have picked this as I am a huge fan of Georges, Tony and Scorpion as a whole, for all the fantasic support they provide in this hobby.

For main blades I have tried the Rail 326's but they did not max out the esc even with a large pitch setup. I then tried the RotorTech 360mm 3 blade's. They were ok but I got a could of very bad pitch ups and the heli was not stable at high speed. I then ordered two pairs of 363mm XBlades and used three of them. They turned out to really nice at high velocity, high RPM(3650) and high pitch angles (16 deg). For the tail blades I am using the Switch 60mm blades.

To get the headspeed I wanted I needed a 14 tooth pinion. With a 5mm hole. Tunred out this was not easy to find. Lynx had some end-of-line ones still in stock but they had the smalled 3mm hole. So ordered a bunch of them and got some 5mm drills and got my dad to use his lathe to drill out the centre. 

Getting the pitch of all three blades was not simple so ended up making my own turnbuckles. So odered up some 3mmx25 titanium turnbuckles from a RC Car supplier. Drilled and Tapped Gaui ball ends to cope with 3mm thread (left and righ threads)

Given the very high loads on the main gears I use Dryfluid Gear on both the gears and thrusts.

For flight packs I started with my favorite Optipowers but getting stock of them is really tricky. I took a shot at the new Turnigy Graphenes:
TURNIGY GRAPHENE 1500MAH 6S 65C LIPO
Amazingly they are incredible during a speed flight. Really shocked. The telementry shows they keep their voltage even under huge load. One issue is that they are heavy but given how much power I have.. its not such a big deal.

For the flybarless the choice was simple: BavarianDEMON 3SX with a Jeti Rex3 rx 

Given the high amp loads I have always had a worry about loosing power to the rx. So for safety I added a R2 3x25 buffer.
